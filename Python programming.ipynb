You don`t have to have a college degree to serve. You don`t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace. A soul generated by love. - Martin Luther King Jr.': 0.48685843047176264, 'Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable. - C.S. Lewis': 0.2782048174124358, 'We all wish to be judged by our peers, by the men `after our own heart.` Only they really know our mind and only they judge it by standards we fully acknowledge. Theirs is the praise we really covet and the blame we really dread. The little pockets of early Chrstians survived because they cared exclusively for the love of `the bretheren` and stopped their ears to the opinion of the Pagan society around them. But a circle of criminals, cranks, or perverts survives in just the same way; by becoming deaf to the opinion of the outer world, by discounting it as the chatter of outsiders who `don`t understand,` of the `conventional,` the `bourgeois,` the `Establishment,` of prigs, prudes, and humbugs. - C.S. Lewis': 0.2479184123145613, 'I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. - Charles Dickens': 1.9474337218870506, 'Show me your hands. Do they have scars from giving?
